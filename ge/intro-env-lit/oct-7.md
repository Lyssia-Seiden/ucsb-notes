# lecture - before the flood

## intro w theology - judeo christian

Genesis is founding religeous text for ~4.4billion people
37% of Americans believe Eden is historically accurate

prof. argues that the opening chapters of the Bible are the most influential pages ever written given the influence they have on various ideologies

profound influences on:
 1. gender - binary, patriarchy
 2. creation + evolution
 3. evil & sin
 4. sex (& sin)
 5. free will + destiny
 6. cosmology
 7. labor
 8. animal rights
 9. deity
...

Lynn White Jr. started ecocriticism of Judeo-Christian faith
posited that Christianity's ideals are enourmously environmentally harmful

environmentalists followed those ideas wrt Christianity being harmful
-> taosim, shinto, buddhism, native american, new age religeons studied and promoted

some Christian leaders *are* committed environmentalists
incl. Pope Francis

Al Gore devout Baptist -> went to school but not ordained

Christianities view towards environmentalism is hermeneutic, it depends near entirely on interpretation

## Genesis

from the first line God is metaphysical, apart from, superior to, and creator of all
similar to shamash wrt metaphysicality
radical difference from Genius Loci, disconnected from the earth

ex nihilo -> God creates from nothing
ex deo    -> God creates from Himself

belief that god is on earth is relatively new

creates a rift between physical and metaphysical

Lynn White Jr: the lack of Genius Loci allows for indifferent exploitation

colonialism + spread of christianity "killed off" Genius Loci

LWJ + others argues that this was the key change that poisoned human attitudes towards the environment

### god creates plants

earth is subordinate + obediant to god

natural ruled by metaphysical

environmentalists argue that dualism problematic
mtaphysical > physical -> finds the physical unimportant

### god creates man

declares humans have control over all life on earth

in some versions "be fruitful and multiply . . . subdue [the earth]"

notion of human dominion

Dominion v Stewardship comes up later

LWJ - "Christianity is the most anthropocentric religeon the world has seen"

anthropocentrism is a key study for environmentalism

opposite of anthropocentrism is biocentrism

modern biology shows we share significant DNA and have many similarities to other life
used as argument for biocentrism

hebrew translations of words translate to "tramp down" and other heirarchical terms

Genesis views human creation and animal creates as very different, unlike scientific views or many traditional or indigenous religeons

Genesis 1:28

also argues for overpopulation -> see modern arguments wrt abortion, birth control, etc.

### genesis 2 electric boogaloo

'adam -> "made of clay"
'adama-> "earth"
Christian theologans argue humans are 1/2 body, 1/2 soul, soul is more important
the "real" you, the soul, trancends body -> see heaven/hell
associates humanity w metaphysical God, disregards physical reality (temporary, illusory, evil)

## metaphysical dualism

dual nature: body and soul
names change, ideas are similar
flesh, spirit

theological argument that only humans have a soul
more extreme environtmentalist argument is that this view encourages humans to be bad guests on earth, as they are spending hardly any time on earth and are soon to return to god eternally

other systems do not allow for dual nature, and place humans entirely on earth

genesis 2:15 suggests that humans are placed to protect the planet
