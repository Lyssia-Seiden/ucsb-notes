# finishing last lecture

Varro contemporary of Virgil
describes practical sides of farming
detailed strategy of slave exploitation
in Varro, awareness of animals thinking/feeling, and uses that to develop strategies to maximize profit
mindset of dissasociating self from suffering of others

Varro argued that you should break chickens legs so they cant move and burn calories
now, just pack them tightly so they cant
california had to legislate requiring 1sqft/chicken so they could move at least some

this lack of caution about exploiting life common in rome, allows mass exploitation
separation of humans and animals encourages doing whatever we want with them

Virgil and Varro contemporary to each other, within a decade
both adversarial wrt nature

capitalism ideas has been growing since these ideas and before

Virgil explored environmental conciousness, but did not question adversarial relationship w planet
