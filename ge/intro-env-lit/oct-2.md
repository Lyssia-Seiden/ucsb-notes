## giglamesh intro

Uruk:
surrounded by a wall
designed to protect against
1. other people
2. environment
environment seen as a threat
theme in West

protect against predators, weeds, etc.

also boasts of built gardens, not natural

distinciton between country and city
"diad", nature and culture in opposition

literal physical separation via walls
in gilgamesh, culture is what is celebrated

perception of "natural" vs "unnatural" is (rooted in) very old (ideas)

this distinction is somewhat unique to the West

the natural vs unnatural structure has been (relatively recently) inverted
nature valued over the city
the creation of suburbs is predicated on transit systems + value of nature

advertisement of food, etc leans on "natural"

"organic" is the only one with real meaning

in gilgamesh the unnatural is artistic, valuable human achievement
praise of brickword, buildings

## gilgamesh character

the epic was sung before it was written (or indeed writing was invented)

the epic is nearly the only information we have about the likely real historical figure

the lines about "right of the lord" and using women also shows the women as possessions of the father, husband, or king

comparing G to Enkidu as doubles of each other becomes interesting
E is a protector; contrast w G particularly wrt women

## Enkidu

protector
1. animals, frees them from traps
2. a bride, blocking G from entering a newlyweds house
3. Gilgamesh, as commanded by elders, in fight against Humbaba

E is policing boundary between natural & unnatural
when he joins society his role is inverted
binary structure of nature vs civilization

G is not the only double for E

E is also a double for Humbaba

## Humbaba

protector of the cedar forest, home to temple to Ishtar

described as monster, but truly protector

many ancient religeons have "genius loci" or divine protectors of rivers, mountains, and forests (or other important places)

genius loci protect ecsclusively against humans, not gods or animals
assumes a binary between human and nature

genius loci calls for worship of earth instead of worship of a god

this belief is important bc it ties divinity to earth rather than metaphysical realm

typically religeons allowed for some usage of places, but only under limitations to avoid wrath of genius loci

this belief was the case in many many non Western religeons across the planet

in Gilgamesh; real forest, was referenced in bible and actually clear cut in G's era

## 

principal weapons are axes, cast
casting implies technology, axes implies resource manipulation
the invention of these technologies allows for exploitation of the forest,
but the religeous feelings about the place (Humbaba) are in the way

"cover story" "propoganda" to allow for exploitation of this resource

description is not of epic battle, but of logging operations
battle is a metaphor/cover for deforestation

description of battle makes simile between Humbaba and cedars

"provocative" how the title character attempts and succeeds to deface a sacred, ancient site
language about entering the forest parallels rape (as in earlier in the story)

## ecofeminism

shift from female dieties (maiden, matron, crone -ie-> persephone, demeter, hecate) to male ones occurred before epic of gilgamesh
argued that preceded patriarchy in modern form
trinity of female dieties in different stages of life

epic shows a shift from female diety Ishtar to male one Shamash
Sh is sun god, beyond the earth (vs ishtar is tied to place)
"why destroy a god?" "i have a bigger, better god behind me"
^ feels like capitalistic, competition

many early religions include female god creating life from clay

epic shows earth diety defeated by humans + metaphysical diety

desire to use resources > religion about earth

story shows a (the?) moment humans decided they were stronger than the environment and its divine protection
