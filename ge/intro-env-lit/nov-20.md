# Walden continued

local eating
humans as genius loci
romaticized countryside ignores urban issues
leads to ignoring env difficulties
may bring issues to country areas see suburbs
see: SUV ads with natural areas
compare to Burtynsky

# Rachel Carson; or, is this a solution

Carson inaugurated first wave US environmentalism
Carson advocates for caring about the planet for its own sake, not for selfishness sake
Carson journalist, not scientist
MA in zoology
writes for general public in US Bureau of Fisheries
chem industry went on offensive vs Carson
example of the ad hominem strategy of discrediting climate activism
"Ms Carson"
most significant single event that leads to current env mvmnt
Silent Spring shifted public from generally embracing technology to suspicion
too far: public is skeptical of all science, even truth and public health -> pandemic
Carson both romanticizes and studies the environment
used both rhetoric and data
^ used by detractors to discredit
