# canturbury tales

pre printing press
equidistant from Rood as today
chaucer uses anthropomorphism
beast fable; allegory for human issues with anthropomorphized animals
use of french descriptors for Chanticleer evokes French speech of english court
literary criticism looks at how disenfranchised groups represented esp when not the writers
only recently serious consideration given to depictions of animals
Varro shows Roman relationship to nonhuman life
similarly, Chaucer can show his culture's relatioship to animals, farming, etc
aesop and many others also use anthropomorphism, but this style becomes very popular in middle age england
these fables are *not* about animals really, just using them to describe human issues
havent really asked what rights animals or plants have historically
see: Overstory book (i know that one!)
anthoropomorphism does little to engender sympathy for nonhuman life
can engender sympathy through humanizing\

current day anthropomorphism common
-> micky mouse
even when they have interiority they speak human language and have human struggles
if anthropomorphism doesnt engender sympathy, what will?

# the actual lecture for today brought to you by being 30 minutes late

aka renaissance
t minus 400 years to rn

this is where we see truly modern env issues
fossil fuels, urban air pollution, etc.
1500-1700s is both "Renaissance" or "early modern"
Petrarch: nothing between collapse of Rome and his time (early ren.) -> dark ages
during that time wasnt possible to engineer pantheon
the tech to create these structures rediscovered in Ren. see St. Peters Basilica
Ren. is backwards looking; early modern forward

## air pollution

env in early modern england was unique at the time
air pollution, acid rain, wetland loss, consumerism become major issues
"patient zero" of many current problems
today pop triples in one lifetime; then 10x in 200yr
94% of england deforested by 1400sCE
as early as 1200-1300CE coal becomes major fuel source in London
1286 first commission against air pollution, 1307 first laws against coal burning

bubonic plague in 1348 limited early problem
by Shakespeare preplague pop, england 3-4x coal consumption of rest of europe, most burned in london
acid rain leads to death/extinction of many animals, plants, and fish
also respiratory disease among humans

by Milton's time, resp. disease was 2nd only to plague as cause of death in London
smog coined from "smoke-fog" at this time
London's weather was special in that fog hangs over it; low winds

depictions of Hell from this time often draw from London's sulferous smog
