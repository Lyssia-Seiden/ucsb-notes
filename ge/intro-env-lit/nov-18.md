# Thoreau

Walden
very autobiogrpahical, but embelished and edited
very little immediatae effect, unlike Carson
populra in 1960s 
Thoreau transitions env thinking to present feelings, as built over the past few centuries
loco-descriptive as shown in title
Thoreau draws from Denham and derives lifestyle from his writings
starts calling for lifestyle changes to fight consumerism instead of just talking abt the problem
dismisses fashion and housing as excessive, unlike other animals
see modern micro apartments, etc as modern lines from thoreau
johnson and lanyer anthropocentric: nature willingly serves humans
thoreau very ecocentric
"biocentric"
all of the life in the env is important
over the course of the book "I" fades to give way to env
Walden pond portrayed as near character; anthropomorphism
visually thoreaus contemporaries moved away from anthropocentrism
even thoreau is anthropocentric in the end; is it invetiable?
smth smth ecofacism
humans control 90% of earth's land; ecocentrism impossible
-> stewardship
