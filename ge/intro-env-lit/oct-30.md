"Cookham" written for L.s patorn, Margaret Clifford
inversion of normal men paying other men to write
"homosocial" group, ie single gender group
"Description of Cookham" -> "country-house" style

country-estate dies with "Upon Appleton House" -> loco descriptive lit.
"C" echoes Virgil Eclogue 1 wrt exilee developing env conciousness
anthropomorphizes the landscape
still anthropocentric
form of stewardship ie humans rule and tend to land, are needed by land

"To Penshurts" is pastoral mode "coutry-house" genre
mcmansions of the day; marble, **gold**, etc.
"TP" criticizes these
