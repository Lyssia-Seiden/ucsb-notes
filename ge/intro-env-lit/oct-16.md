# who up lecing they ture - Pastoral, ecocriticism

Pastoral is not a genre
it is a *mode*
beyond literature

## Pastoral

lack of human presence, although not necessarily complete absense
inviting

## art + lit

often depicts pastures (big surprise)
pastoral not necessarily about shepherds, sheep, or environment

often metaphorical or allegorical rather than being about the environment
used to approach politics, religeon
^ masked political writing
often intersects literal and allegory

pastoral often has locus amoenus, perfect environmentally peaceful time
part of city/country diad, as early as 3rd CE country prefered

imagines locus amoenus as distant place, not time

migration towards suburbs came from desire for less urban environments

pastoral is similar to notion that childhood was better
"simpler time"

cottagecore is a recent take on pastoral
pastoral generally becomes popular when social unrest is brewing

Asher Brown Durand's "Pastoral Landscape"
painted before civil war, imagines a simpler, more perfect, more beautiful place
nostalgia

imagined "not-too-distant" in time and space
utopian

one irony of pastoral is sheep are very good at keep areas deforested

lack of labor also part of locus amoenus
includes poetry, lyrics, song
carefreeness

pastoral almost always made by urbanites
rarely accurately depicts country life

because pastoral is the most common mode, but it is very innaccurate, skews cultural ideas about countryside!

pastoral tropes leaned on by environmental lit, including *Silent Spring*

##

we are not fully aware of the env. because we are distracted by the unusual
analogy of loosing a friend you dont appreciate it until you loose it

example from UCSB
oil spill in 1969, worst at the time
greatly increased awareness of fragility of beaches
this spill is regarded as one of the major catalysts for US environmentalist movements
"shocking" awareness of a problem -> env conciousness
artist/writer -> tries to inspire this in others

traditional pastoral (pristine country) was made in contrast to urban environmental changes

until recently, often assumed that these were accurate depictions
not the case, writing was actually about urban environments by demonstrating a fictional converse

contrasting pristine envs. to endandgered ones suggests the opposite, welcomingness means that humans were changing it
