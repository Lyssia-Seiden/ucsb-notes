# genisis, gilgamesh, and more

John Donne "The world is a carcass"
christian theology presents the world as doomed and only humans as salvagable
christian theology presents environmental tipping point with the Fall

Jeremy Cohen argues whether premodern Jews and Christians were as indifferent as Lynn argued

## Intro to greek metaphysical thinking - eco philosophy

Hesiod also has Eden-like notions
"Golden race of mortal men" - later "golden age"
"rich in flocks" -> pastoral -> common theme
in Hesiods time humans could "never rest"
theme of rosy view of the past

Hesiod tells the story of Pandora having a "shameless mind and decceitful nature"
similar to Eve wrt misogyny
before Pandora (or Eve) released evil everything was great

Greco-Roman tradition and Judeo-Christian tradition both have the "woman fucked things up" founding myth

these myths of a magical time w humans at peace w planet live on even in secular culture

Raymond Williams "nature" and "culture" are most complex words in english
very complicated concept, so reasoning about it is difficult!

nature often synonym w environment landscape wilderness
lack of human habitation

nature/culture dyad in the West
place humans seperate from natuer
this is not constant among all cultures
Buddhism for example

greeks conceived of nature "temporally" not "spacially"


Goldsworthy art
ice sculpture
wall made of stones from crumbling walls
hut made of deccaying branches
shows how nature is temporal; in flux, changing, temporary

"nature is endless process"
"coming into and out of being"

there is no permanence in nature; this is at odds w religious concepts of heaven

artists throughout history have attempted to stand against the test of time
crumbled greek columns stand testament to their folly
Gilgamesh's city was buried in dust

some pre-Socratic philosophers had views like Goldsworthy

### Heracites

"impossible to step twice into the same river"

Plato redefines nature to no longer be the process of change, but rather to reference permanence
H: you cant step in the same river twice
Cratylus: you cant step in it once

Socrates + Plato argued that there must be more than eternal change
imagined platonic ideal realm; metaphysical realm
"metaphysical" lit. "beyond change"

placed metaphysical realm as superior to physical realm
-> Plato argued metaphysical realm the "only true nature"

### Heidegger

argued that modern technology is the "completion of metaphysics"
argued that a dam converts a fickle stream into a constant source
argued that the dam becomes an entity free from change
while there are differences, it is closer to metaphysical ideal than the original stream
