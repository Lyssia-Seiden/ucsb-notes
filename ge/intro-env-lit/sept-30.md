# Intro to Environmental Science Lecture #1 - Intro to the Environmental Humanities & Ecocriticism

## What is environmental criticism?

> Environmental criticism is similar to other forms of cultural criticism
> Marxist, postcolonial, feminist, queer theory

Feminist critics study literary repr of gender and women over time
Environmental criticism is analogous wrt nature, natural world

These studies are often intersectional

Studies like this also influence culture

90% of ghgs since 1945, but ideas that lead to that go back thousands of years

## Western "Big Books"

Discuss Western thinking -> driving force behind current global culture

"American Way of Life" aka "Imperial Mode of Living"
Colonization spread from western countries, global north has a different standard of living than the rest of the world.

Insufficient time to focus on non Western thinking, focus on West bc of importance in environmental impacts

Similar to feminism taking a harder look at norms about patriarchy, ecocriticism takes a look at and balances values against current ideals towards the environment

## Ecocriticism

Range of periods and responses.

History of deforestation as the West spreads is much of the root (haha) of the problem.

Deforestation, air pollution, extinction, wetlands, animal rights, consumerism, etc are all issues hundreds or thousands of years old.

Any medium or genre can have significance; we live in the world after all

"Rockstar" Nickleback - 20 years old, but shows imperial thinking in a way that is alive and well
Lists things he wants, big house with huge rooms
"the good life" is an old question
this song's answer is excessive wealth
references Cribs, which shows cultural obsession beyond the few who can attain it, driving ideals about the good life
criticism of "trophy" houses extends for thousands of years
ideology of winning big and losing big drives our culture

wealthiest 1% = poorest 5 billion wrt greenhouse emissions
100 avg americans consume more resources than towns and large villages in low and moderate income countries

a decade ago showing off jets, etc. was more popular
now its abstracted in the form of money partially due to fire from environmentalism, but still shows same ideology

we learn from the cultures we grow up in; by being exposed to homelessness as a child, we learn that this is the way things are

## Niagra

woodblock of niagra falls
Romantic poetry inspired

pair of humans visible in tiny form on a cliff
smaller even than birds
humans are kneeling, bowing, or otherwise not upright, showing reverence
similar to religeous works of his (Dore)
view of environment as romantic and awe inspiring, to a divine degree
difference from, for example, Milton

## Some useful ideas

Environmental criticism, aka "green" or "ecocriticism"
denonym is "ecocritic"

"environment" is broad, includes wilderness and constructed environments
farm, city, suburb are all valid environments to explore

"ecology" coined in 1866, suggests that all life on earth is interconnected.
exists in non Western thinking much longer

ecology derives from Greek words for household and study

## Why ecocritise?

each approach is valid and useful in its own right
but also is vital for the environmental crisis
no simple set of solutions to environmental crisis

approach studying culture + history is "uniquely useful"
to understand, ask:

## Why study literature?

diversion (see surfing the internet, some films, any of the "consumerist" entertainment industries)
pleasure (vicariousness, see romance)
education

understanding human nature or the human condition
"New Criticism"
widely used until ~1970
features include considering history irrelevant, enduring ideas (like beauty wrt Plato) are considered important
often alive in literary courses because its easier to teach in isolation

to understand hisotry
concurrent w New Criticism
unpopular because time consuming, difficult to teach, lacks "contemporary payout"

to understand our own cuture
learn about the past to know how the present came to be
New Historicism

to understand ourselves as a cultural and historical artifact

## New Historicism

appears around 1980
it had a major impact on various cultural studies in this century
requires great deal of research
uses history to interpret the present
interprets ourselves by understanding where we come from, as we are formed by our culture of birth

Traditional Historicism
uses old text to interpret historical cultures
"hermeneutics" related to interpretation
entirely directed at past

New Historicism
old texts -> interpret -> historical culture -> which allows us -> interpret -> present day culture ideas and selves -> informs understanding of old texts
^ hermeneutic circle
