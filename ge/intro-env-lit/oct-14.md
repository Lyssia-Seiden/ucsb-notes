# more eco lit

"fossilized solar energy"
similar to reservoir, stockpile that can be deployed
similar uses to sun => heat, light

in a sense, our obsession w fossil fuels is metaphysical
struggle with uncontrolled change

Heidegger argues that all natural resources are for our use
also all people are human resources for exploitation

## the real new lecture - what is nature?

dualism has existed in the west for a long time, metaphysical prioritized
problematic because this prioritization is highly present in our day and age
in a mass technological way

metaphusis
^ God
^ Heaven
^ Platonic Ideals

phusis
^ reality
^ earth
^ plants
^ animals
^ process
^ sense experience

Deity:

metaphysical
^ Shamash in gilgamesh
^ JudeoChristian God

"physical"
^ Genius Loci
^ some ancient goddess figures (Persephone/Demeter/Hecate)

### Place
Locus Amoenust pleasent of all places
metaphysical, heaven, etc. 
in contrast to earth, which contains or is defined by imperfection

### Time
metaphysics is changeless
unchanging removes moral relativism
this is why Plato likes metaphysics

"gignomai"
constant change, becoming, passing away

### dualistic humans
^ realm of soul, better or truer part
v realm of the body, inferior, evil

### Plato's divided line
^ intelligible realm
^ ideas, reason
^ true reality
v sensory realm is illusory
v "cheap copy" of real metaphysical realm

why care about the environment if we are temporary and the metaphysical realm is more true?

### Presence/Absense

much of post-Plato philosophy is looking for universal truths
things which do not change over time
God Truth Beauty

"Idea Plato; Substance Aristotle; Subjectivity Descartes; Absolute Spirit Hegel; Will to Power Nietzsche; Presence Heidegger and Derrida"

Phusis is both absense and presence
present -> soon absent

### Artifacts

^ creating something which resists phusis
^ things a culture makes which endure
^ buildings, tombs
v Jingu Shrine is rebuilt every ~20 years, and has been since 7th century

### Art

^ Myth of Gilgamesh created immortality, not forests
^ Shakespeare's sonnets - "Summer's day . . . so long lives this"
 - the idea, the art lives much longer than the subject
v Goldsworthy
v Virgil - stay tuned

### Language

^ logos is the form of a culture's ideas
^ languages live much longer than people, even as they change
^ "eidos" -> "idea" still lives
v languages live and change in cultural context - literature, society

### Modern Technology

^ modern tech is a quest for overcoming uncontrolled change
^ phusis enduring across Time
v Heraclites' stream
v Slow Food movement
v Arendt argues that this does not begin in 18th century

### Ancient Tech

similar reasoning to above
