# lecture time - greece

intro with a bit of showyness about chance/randomness/fate

## recap - egypt

heirarchic scale

## senet

30 spaces - 3 x 10
means something along the lines of passing or travelling

top left and bottom right 5 are decorated

some who believe it is a race game say it might be played in a zig zag from top left to bottom right

icons: 'good'x3, 'water'

egypt had no name for "rndom"
perhaps the cast die was to reveal something from the dead or otherwise otherworldly

casting sticks, die, astragals all used to introduce randomness (or chance, or fate)

## greece

altar: precense suggests religeous space, suggests objects around are significant

body | site of value
sources | motives of looking
social space | cultural meaning
game space | meaning inflected by context -> social space

acropolis to athena parthenos
similar function to ziggurat

greece as a colonizing force, called back to by european colonizing forces
in particular architecture

greece was a democracy of **free men**
not all men were free

greece was a society of cities
greek cities treated each other as friends or rivals
other cities were barbarians
democracy: demos (people of Greece) polis (city state)

different cities would host panhellenic games
cycle of 4 games - greatest was the Olympian
games happened in neutral territory
all demos may participate
part of creating a greek identity

Olympic games - first
in Olympia
every 4 years
then Pythian
delphi 4 years
Isthmian
Isthmya 2 years
Nemean
Nemea & Corith 2 years

mostly individual competitions, but not always

very men only, greek society very gendered

olympia was sacred; altar contained; had to be cleansed to enter

"hera games" outside of panhellenic cycle
women only, clothed
few artifacts from it

games included singing, recitation (poetry and essays), spelling
olympic games were more military
running, javelin, diskos, pole vault,

oil, nudity, gender segregation all served to support greek ideologies around the male body

pentathalon
stade javelin diskos jump wrestling

also shield bearing hoplite racing

lots of battlefield iconography and inspiraton
but also nudity reinforced ritual nature
