hex and counter largely primary form of wargaming in US
Charles Roberts starts after ww2
concepts:
    miniature hard to make money; once rules are sold, not much money to be made
    very simple board easy to make and sell
abstract board, blue v red
counters had many abstract symbols to repr type, size, movement,
RAND created hexagonal grid for wargames, reported on in Life
hex map became standard

##

naturalism and abstraction are relative and equally powerful
naturalism -> form
realism    -> content

speculative art can be naturalistic
the birth of venus, "realistic but not realism"

French Realism <-> French Symbolism
spectrum of style
realism <-> speculative

both ends of spectrum (naturalism, abstraction) are capable of simulation

both naturalism and abstraction have power and limits
