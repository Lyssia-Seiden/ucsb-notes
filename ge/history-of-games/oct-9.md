# form, formal transformation, synthesis - China

stuppas transformed in may ways
eventually came to China
buddhism suppressed in China, so stuppas few and far between
pagodas still have some stuppa elements

pagodas grew from the "cage" on stuppas
retain axis mundi

chaturanga synthesized w existing Chinese games

## older Chinese games

### Liubo

highly decorated boards
abstract lines
central square, outer 8, 4 side rooms
related to geomancy/geography
 - related to fengshui
palindrome 

divination -> game

each board somewhat unique
\- | 4 corners, T reversed

casting sticks as randomizer; in quantity

similar to india, not enough to know the rules

### go

 - believed to be fictional for some time
 - 
500bce - warring stats (weak Zhou)
~200bce - Qin (unification)

Xiangqi started ~800

> before Chaturanga, many games existed in China

#### the game

289 squares grid
game played on the intersections, not spaces

when surrounded by pieces of the opposite color, pieces removed
games were recorded and studied

literati scholar artist class
highly valued calligraphy

Chatrang quickly modified to use intersections instead of spaces
Abstract pieces likely recieved, easy to transform
Pieces became discs with calligraphy
Split board with "river" in middle
Add castle at each end
Emperor is no longer present, just the general (in the castle)
Accompanied by advisors in the castle
Cannons added to front line, must be behind someone to capture

many variations

### Move to Japan

becomes shogi
keep calligraphy
irregular pentagons instead of discs
both sides have meaning
captured pieces join capturers army
can be promoted by reaching other side (3 deep)
9x9, no river
back to spaces
much more complex
more types of pieces
no castle
knight remains the same

theories that promotion and capture was invented in Edo when alliances frequently shifted
