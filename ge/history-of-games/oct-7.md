**read Mark's article before section**

moving towards game called Chaturanga, pass by Backgammon

3kbce->1kbce Harrappa society
- wont discuss much, Indus River
- writing not deciphered, not much evidence of games
- same time as Sumer and early Shang/Zhou
- buried dead

1.5kbce->500ce Vedic society
- conglomeration of societies active after Harrappa
- unclear what led to collapse of Harrappa -> some violence but not total
- Cremated deceased
- few remains
- writings -> Vedas are religeous texts
- much much more writing than Judeo-Christian-Islam
  - some information about games
    - often just a prop for a story
- buddha was vedic
- hinduism also born from Vedics
- Great stupa
  - closed off
  - burial mound of the buddha
  - stand in for the buddha, sacred mountain, and cosmic egg
  - "abstract architectural object"
  - near cave temple supported by nearby village
  - ajanta caves
    - sleeping spaces off of a central courtyard
    - idols in rear facing entrance
    - wonderfully adorned
    - large, carved out space
    - murals cover walls
      - murals include some depictions of games
      - jatakas -> short stories of the buddha
      - each story tells of Buddha's divinity and failings in each life
      - one story is of a life where Buddha likes to play a game with a certain friend
        - friend wants to cheat
        - hides shells in mouth
        - buddha poisons shells
        - friend hides in mouth
        - begins to froth at the mouth
        - chastizes friend
        - gives antidote once done
      - game is largely not important; the story is
      - this level of importance (lack thereof) is common among indian stories
      - game in story oculd be proto-backgammon

## backgammon

form in indian story is very different than modern
but both have the 20 spaces

> can formal variation degrade categorical boundaries?

each variation can be small, but quickly diverges

social space and texts show what is supposed to match what

## stuppa

circumabulation as the core way to interact with it
form varies, but the function remains

the anda -> mountain, egg, buddha

formal variation but enough remains to be analogous -> categorically same

## chaupar

fabric board from 19/20th century

paved board in 1600ce india

variation of configuration scale
variation of order more significant

> **order** => **relationship** of parts for a specific set of **functions**

## we dig and we look and we ... don't find

no text or artifacts of games $\implies$  lack of value, perishability

some depictions exist of proto-backgammon in the depictions of the jattaka
depictions of very powerful people playing games
but the games themselves are hardly depicted or described

demons epicted as entourages
cow depicted as prize

depictions include emotion, weight placed on the game

other games are sometimes depicted in this story
different board configs

8x8 grid depicted
no boards found

this game is . . .

## Chaturanga

soldiers, horsemen, chariots, elephants

we have texts, boards, pieces but not from India
persians have artifacts, text discussing recieving it from india
persians called it "The Kings Game"
persian pieces very abstract
clearly ancestor of Chess

some text about the Chariot (Rook) is missing, including names
sanskrit "Ratha" = Chariot
similar to "Roka" = Ship
Russians designated it "Lodya" = Ship
"Rukh" persian for mythical bird
"Rocca" italian for fortress

complicated story; not enough information

Persian pieces were abstract, abstraction allows change to happen faster
allows "openness of content"

manuscripts showing top down view in addition to side views indicate that *which* game it is is important

persians wrote strategies, recorded famous games
made variations on the rules

King and Mantri were remaning two pieces

Mantri: advisor/general

Chaturanga does still exist in India

Solider - 1 space, persian variaton 2x on first move and diagonal capture
Chariot - Rook
Elephant - Bishoplike, originally limited to 2x spaces
Horseman - like modern Knight

game went India 600
Persia 700
China 800
SEA 900
North Africa 900
Spain/NW Africa 1200
Ukraine/Black Sea 1100
Japan/Korea 1100
and so on
