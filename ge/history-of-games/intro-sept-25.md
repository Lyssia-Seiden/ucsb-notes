"conceptual course", aimed at illustrating broader patterns/concepts

prof is architecture historian; **talk about that w him**

## Concepts

aka the not logistics stuff

- Form
  - "The part of the game we experience through our senses"
  - Slide of ~~chess piece~~ king (from chess)
  - Chess is so broad, may be recognized without being a player
  - Form has characteristics
  - Characteristics drive meaning
  - Form -> content and vice versa
  - Form + Content become representation
  - 2 "modes" of form, abstract and naturalistic
  - representation is delivered by form, of which naturalism and abstraction are aspects
- Game Space
  - scale is irrelevant
  - ex: chess board
  - arguably, side of board where captured pieces go is *also* game space
  - abstraction/naturalism of pieces changes view of board
  - grid as an abstraction
  - grids are important beyond games, what does that relate to?
- Social Space
  - line between game and social space is often blurred
  - "where the player is"
  - exists even in a solitary game
  - cons, esport, etc
- Value
  - goods often buried w bodies historically
  - quantity + quality of labor and materials
