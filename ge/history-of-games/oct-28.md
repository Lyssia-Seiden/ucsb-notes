## the actual lecture :eyes:

kriegsspiel - german for wargame
CRT
fog of war - comes from military, russian officer who once defeated napoleon
upmire

1520 Germany: total mess, extended through modern day belgium, some swiss, austria, bohemia
many kingdoms frequently intermarrying, trading borders
very unstable
-> relatively weak vs France or Russia, (soon to be Great) Britain, even Sweden
early to mid 17th century 4 wars in germany
largely between Russia, France, Hapsburgs (Spain), HRE to the south, Sweden, Austria (mercenaries), England
Protestants vs Catholics
30 years war 1618-1648

after conclusion of these wars, officer prussian Weickmann creates "Kings Game" to teach about war and politics and kingship
Konigs-Spiel
2-18 players
board was a paper map
pieces were evolved from chess pieces - 30/player
game evolved from chess to represent contemporary warfare
game of diplomacy, pieces that were noncombatants
natural, abstract, and iconic pieces drawn
popular in the court and military

Hellwig -> evolving Konigs-Spiel
no paper, need a grid
grid of blocks -> more complex terrain
different colors per side repr diff types of terrain
many types of map repr historical battle locations
added more complex combat mechanics -> better simulations of battle
pieces are whole battallions ->
sleds for pieces to repr different formations
pieces could take damage without total death
piece types modernized and simplified - no king
 - infantry
 - dragoons
 - cavalry
 - artillery
pieces had a direction
dice involved in combat resolution

Venturini
added fortifications
seasons and weather

name morphed towards Kriegsspiel

19th century
wars between prussia and france (napoleon)
defeats of prussia by france were humiliating
elaborated on wargaming in response
increased naturalism of board
iconography influential for repr battalions
no grid; gauges used to regulate movement
more complex dice with many numbers
Combat Results Table(CRT)
published in 1812 as Taktisches Kriegs-Spiel
revised in 1824 by son of creator

fog of war
Clausewitz writes that leader never knows all info but must still act
added umpire/referee and double blind system
game is a mere conversation
umpire asks questions, player answers with instructions
umpire has an elaborate map in an isolated room, with true state of the game
isolated, the players send and recieve messages
player has a map maintained by the player, which is based on umpire's information
player's could be teams with many maps and complex chains of command, divisions running sub games

prussia grows to strongest german principality, absorbs them, becomes germany through war
went as far as paris
austria, denmark
prussian "mode of war and training" becomes standard
wargaming becomes prime mode of training and planning real battles
Germany stuck with powerful France and Russia sandwhiching them
German military power lead to mutual defense treaties
Germany knew that it would lose a 2 front war
by 1908, railroads were so strong that Germany believed it could win both fronts in 30 days before other countries could respond
Wargames became policy drivers
German wargames decided they could take France and Russia after Austria-Hungary spark in 1914
we know how that ends
