# rules draft 1


Full Rulebook Draft:

	Step into the world of art enthusiasts, museum curators and wealthy eccentrics as you compete with 1-3 other players to obtain paintings and make the best art exhibit! Create chains of powerful combinations by creating a synergistic art exhibit focused on either:
Expanding your painting collection by drawing more from a vast deck
Raising money for your exhibit by rolling a die.
Advertising your exhibit and becoming the most popular on the market!
Win the game by ending the game with the most points. Your points will be calculated by your exhibits total value, placements in the goals track, world renown, number of benefactors, donors gained and supporting works. 

Compete for a random set of goals throughout the game to earn extra points!

Components:
8 action indicators per player
Deck of 100 paintings
20 donor tokens
100 currency indicators
10 Goal indicators
3 Dice
70 Admirer Tokens

Shuffle the painting deck, and then place 3 face up cards so that they are most visible to all players. 
Place the Currency, Admirer and Donor Tokens all together. 
Place the 3 Dice in an accessible location to all players.
Place the three benefactors in the middle of the players. 
Shuffle the Auction Paintings and randomly select four of them to place face down in the middle of the players, then reveal the first one to the players and keep it face up next to the face down ones. 
Each player chooses which 3 bird cards they want to keep, they can also optionally keep less in exchange for one extra currency per bird card they unnecessarily discard. 
Each player rolls a dice and whoever has the highest number starts


Overview (Structure of turns, Structure of game rounds, goals etc)
Each game will consist of 4 rounds, a round is over once all players have exhausted their action indicators. 

On a player turn four different actions are available:
Raise Funds
Draw Paintings
Play Painting
Advertise

To use an action, place an action indicator on the part of your player mat that corresponds to that action. 
Then gain the benefit indicated by your progress on the corresponding benefactor's slider and activate any painting powers you've placed that activate when you take that action. 

Once you've finished, leave your action indicator on that part of your mat and move to the next player. 

Once all players have exhausted all of their action indicators the end of round auction begins:
Remaining admirers and cards in players hands can be used as currency for the purpose of auctions. (Admirers each count as two currency and each painting card from hand counts as three)
Each player makes a silent bet on the amount of currency they wish to spend to try and acquire the auction piece. 
Write down the amount you want to spend. 
Whoever had the last turn reveals the winner and they are awarded the painting card

Auction cards: 
An auction card can and should be immediately played, it ignores any of the normal costs of playing a painting.
Auction cards can count as any but not all of the types of paintings and can advance your influence on any of the global Figures (these don't necessarily have to match)
These cards are usually very powerful either through sheer value or powerful unique effects 

After the auction has concluded the round is over, follow these steps:
Remove all action indicators from your players mats
Activate any end of round powers on your paintings. 
Award Round Goal points on the goal trackers by each placing an action indicator on the goal tracker based on where you placed in the goals. 
Expand the number of face up cards available to draw by 1. 
Start with the next player.

Inspire painting: This means you can put another painting beneath one you already have in your exhibit, this painting is now a supporting work to your existing one.
