## Max

terrain gen. infinite 3d world

current: physics wasd/trackpad nav
everything other than worldgen is ready
normal rendering/shading
seeded


goods
- lots of room to explore
- browser based and compatible
- otf generation cool :thumbsup:

bads
- hard to see shape of terrain with current shading
- hard to move with trackpad; alternative?
- first person might not be the only perspective a user cares about

## Veeral

hard and annoying to write latex
handwriting imgs or pdfs -> latex
eventually app with persistant storage, geometric diagrams

good
- very useful, clear use cases
- prior art
- lots of ability to adjust scope as needed

bad
- likely many many edge cases
- generating clean latex may be subjective
- hard to get sufficient, labelled data

## sreyes

demand forcasting for retail
website with configuration for different goods
hardcoded rn
model analyzes trends
overfitted on synthetic data atm
lots of analysis metrics
trying to get real data

good:
- lots of metrics, graphs!
- room to adjust models

bad:
- data hard to find
- synthetic data is messy
- limited ability to simulate disturbances

## me :D

chords for other keys
currently no chords :(
monkeytype style tester app
mirror in android studio :eyes:

good
- cool concept
- no nonsense ui
- system keyboard integration

bad
- limited chord permutations
- no prediction/other speedup features
- one handed version?

## vanessa

platformer
interactibles to build platforms
time limits

good
- time trials provide simple but extensible game loop
- existing tooling provides clear paths forward
- cute style

bad
- movement needs tuning
- graphics bugs
- need to have a full level to start iterating
