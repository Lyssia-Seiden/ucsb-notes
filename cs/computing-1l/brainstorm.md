# 1L Project Brainstorming

 1. LLVM (or an HDL or a diff IR) to Factorio (or custom interpreter?)
 2. Zig (or other simple) IR to RISCV (or other simple ISA/execution env)
 3. Custom minimal OS for an STM or RP MC or similar
 4. Handwriting -> Latex (pix2tex (not feasible, custom model needed) + writing)
