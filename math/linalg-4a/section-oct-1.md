## Worksheet

1.
a. Define a *linear equation* in variables x_1, x_2, ..., x_n
equation in the form a_1x_1 + a_2x_2 + ... + a_nx_n = b

b. Define a solution
Some set of *x*s `[x_1, x_2, ..., x_n]` s.t. all equations in the system are truthful

c. define consistent
The system has 1 or infinite solution(s)

d. define inconsistent
The system has no solution

2.
a. Every elementary row operation is reversible
True
b. Elementary row operations on an augmented matrix never change the solution set of the associated linear system
True
c. a 5x6 matrix has 3 rows
False
d. when there are free variables, the solution is unique
False

3.
a. (x_1 - 1)(x_2 + 1) = 0
Not linear, contains a factor of x_1x_2
b. 5x_1 = 2x_2 - 3x_3 + 4
Linear, contains no terms in `x_n^c` where c > 1
c. x_1 + x_2^2 + ... + x_n^n = 0
Non linear, contains x^n where n > 1
d. sin^2(x_3)x_1 + x_2 = 4 - cos^s(x_3)x_1
Linear
sin^2(x_3)x_1 + cos^2(_3)x_1 + x_2 = 4
x_1 + x_2 = 4

4. 
3x + 2y - 4z = 1
2x - 6y + 2z = -4
4x + 8y - 12z = 12
a
3 2 -4 = 1
2 -6 2 = -4
4 8 -12 = 12

1 -3 1 = -2
3 2 -4 = 1
4 8 -12 = 12

1 -3 1 = -2
0 11 -7 = 7
0 20 -16 = 20

1 -3 1 = -2
0 1 -0.8 = 1
0 11 -7 = 7

1 0 -7/5 = 1
0 1 -0.8 = 1
0 11 -7 = 7

1 0 -7/5 = 1
0 1 -0.8 = 1
0 0 1.8 = -4

1 0 -7/5 = 1
0 1 -0.8 = 1
0 0 1 = -20/9

i messed up somewhere (?) wrt row 1's constant
1 0 -7/5 = 1
0 1 0 = -7/9
0 0 1 = -20/9

> 1 0 0 = -19/9
> 0 1 0 = -7/9
> 0 0 1 = -20/9

c.
x = 77/9
y = -7/9
z = -20/9

5.
2x_1 - 4x_2 + 3x_3 + 4x_4 = 0
3x_1 - 6x_2 -  x_3 - 5x_4 = 0

a
2 -4 3 4 = 0
3 -6 -1 -5 = 0

1 -2 3/2 2 = 0
3 -6 -1 -5 = 0

1 -2 3/2 2 = 0
0 0 -11/2 -11 = 0

1 -2 3/2 2 = 0
0 0  1   2 = 0

1 -2 0 -1 = 0
0 0  1   2 = 0

x_1 -2x_2 - x_4 = 0
x_3 + 2x_4 = 0

> x_1 = 2r + s
> x_2 = r
> x_3 = -2s
> x_4 = s
