# Lyssia's UCSB course notes

This repo contains notes from my classes while attending UCSB as a CCS Computing major.
Notes are arranged into folders roughly by topic, then by class.
For example, the `cs` folder contains classes from CoE and CCS Computer Science courses.
Within `cs`, `computing-1a` and other classes can be found.
Each class folder has notes, figures, code, and other files related to that course.
